# E-Commerce-Data
First, I started with cleaning the data and exploring it for the missing values, incorrect values etc.
Then I got some questions to answer:
#### Questions that are proposed in this notebook:
- Which country has the maximum payment customer?
- What is the most popular purchase?
- Timelines of purchases in different countries
- The most expensive unit prices countries


#### Libraries used in that project:
- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- seaborn
